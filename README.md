# Aim of the Deterministic Workshop

This workshop offers an interactive introduction to the main functionality of the hmer package, using a simple example of an epidemiological model. 
hmer allows you to efficiently implement the Bayes Linear emulation and history matching process, a calibration method that has been successfully employed 
in several sciences (epidemiology, cosmology, climate science, systems biology, geology, energy systems etc.).

In this workshop, you will be invited to carry out a series of tasks (see “Task” boxes) which will enhance your understanding of the package and its tools. 
Thanks to these activities, you will learn to calibrate deterministic models using history matching and model emulation, and to use your judgement to 
customise the process. This workshop should be considered as a natural continuation of [Tutorial 1](https://danny-sc.github.io/Tutorial_1/), which introduces the history matching with emulation 
framework with a one-dimensional example, and of [Tutorial 2](https://danny-sc.github.io/Tutorial_2/), which gives a general overview of the history matching with emulation process for 
deterministic models, and shows how to perform it using hmer. Following Workshop 1, you may also want to read [Workshop 2](https://danny-sc.github.io/stoch_workshop/), where we demonstrate how 
to calibrate stochastic models.
